# <First-Working-App>

## Description

I created a study guide website for storing notes and other information pertaining to my bootcamp:

- Needed a central location for my class notes and stufy materials
- I created this page to be a reference and practice page
- This solves the issue of having written notes that can be lost
- I learned how to deploy an app!
